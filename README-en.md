## Using Shadcn UI Components

This project has integrated [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com). Follow these steps to install/edit components and use them:

### Shadcn Structure Initialization

Execute `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init` command to initialize the basic project structure for `Shadcn UI` (if not already initialized)

💡 Note

> This initialization command is used to create the basic project structure for `Shadcn UI`
>
> **This project has already been initialized, so there's no need to run this command again**

### Component Installation

1. Use `Shadcn CLI` to add components:

   ```bash
   pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component-name>
   ```

   For example, to add the `<Alert />` component, execute the following command, [see documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/alert#installation)

   ```bash
   pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add alert
   ```

2. Using components

```tsx
import { Alert, AlertDescription, AlertTitle } from '@/components/ui/alert'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <Alert>
      <AlertTitle>Heads up!</AlertTitle>
      <AlertDescription>
        You can add components and dependencies to your app using the cli.
      </AlertDescription>
    </Alert>
  )
}
```

3. Customizing component styles (optional)

`Shadcn UI` components typically provide popular default styles and functionality that meet most needs. If you truly need to customize, you can edit the respective component files, such as:

Open [`src/components/ui/alert.tsx`](src/components/ui/alert.tsx) to modify the styles of the `Alert` component

> Tips: In most cases, the default styles provided by `Shadcn UI` are sufficient to meet requirements without additional modifications
